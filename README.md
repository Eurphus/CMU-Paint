# CMU-Painting
Simple painting canvas using python and the CMU Graphics library.

This code was meant to run inside a sandbox environment provided by [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu). The library is included with this project, and should work similar, if not the same to the website environment.
